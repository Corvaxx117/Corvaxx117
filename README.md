👋 Salut ! Ici Julien Amiel 

🌐 Web Developer | Inetum - Aix-en-Pce

I’m currently balancing my time between real-world experience at Inetum and academic growth at OpenClassrooms. My journey started at the 3W Academy, where I earned my diploma, and it's been full steam ahead ever since. Now, as a developer at Inetum, I get to work on dynamic projects that fuel my passion for building web experiences that stand out.

💻 My Tech Arsenal:
🔮 Languages: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL
⚙️ Frameworks: Strong in Symfony and WordPress
🚀 Skills: Building dynamic web applications, crafting seamless backend solutions, and bringing designs to life with CSS wizardry
🐘 Backend: Deeply familiar with PHP, MySQL, and the LAMP stack

📚 Always Growing, Always Coding
Web development is an ever-evolving field, and I’m constantly honing my skills. Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into Symfony and exploring new front-end techniques to make my projects more engaging and performant. Learning is my fuel, and I love that there’s always something new to master.

🌟 Why I’m Here on GitHub
GitHub is my digital workshop—a place where I document my journey, showcase my skills, and collaborate on projects. Here, you’ll find a mix of my works. I’m always open to connecting with like-minded developers, sharing knowledge, and learning from the community.
